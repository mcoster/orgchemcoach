Mark makes stuff.

When he’s not making stuff, he’s teaching other people how to make stuff. Mark was one of those kids who loved nothing more than to build things out of Lego. He still feels that joy, but now his ‘stuff’ is molecules that he builds from atoms. The stuff he makes might one day save a sick child from malaria.

And he still likes Lego too.
